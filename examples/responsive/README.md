This is a [Kobweb](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb) project instantiated from the `examples/responsive` template.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to define responsive layouts (i.e. layouts that respond to the
screen size changing).

To run the sample, simply enter the following command in the terminal:

```bash
kobweb run
```

and open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.
